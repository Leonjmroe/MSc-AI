      "\" Some of you might have read my previous post on the Ford TaurusSome might not haveRight now im at my wits end I took my 1999 Ford Taurus SE to the shop for warranty workThe vehicle has 10 000 miles on it Quality used to be Job One at FordId say thats the least of their concerns right now One of the warranty issues I have with Ford is the display on my car stereo blinks on and offThe radio worked fineas far as sound wentbut the visual display had a short or something in itI thought taking it in and having it fixed would be a simple taskUnfortunatelyI was wrong They kept my car for eight daysThey said they couldnt just change out my radio for a new oneFord requires they send the old radio to the factory for repairs At the end of the eighth daythe dealership contacted me to say my car was readyand to come pick it upI went aheadpicked the car upsat down in the drivers seatput the key in the radioand there was no display for the radioIn factnot only was there no displaybut now the sound didnt work at allThe radio was a piece of dead hardware I immediately got the service advisor overand asked why Ford didnt check to see if the radio was actually working before they sent the radio backThey didnt have an answer for meand said that was stupid of Ford to do that I thought things would go welland Ford overnighted the radio over and had it repairedthen overnighted the radio backI was called today and told to come pick the car up I turned on the radiothe car seemed to run fineFifteen minutes out of the dealershipthe radio died once again I returned to the dealershipwho told me that they would once again have to send the radio BACK to Fordand have Ford work on it againI inquired why I cant get a new radiofiguring the car is only a few months oldand they said thats not Fords policyand they can work on the radio as many times as needed until the problem is resolved Meanwhileim renting a car once againat29 99 a daymy dimeFord doesnt provide loaners unless you purchase their extended warrantywhile Ford keeps tinkering with my car stereo instead of replacing it It would seem to me that to keep a customer happyFord would have just exchanged the radio after a few attempts to fix it with no availHoweverrules are rulesand the customer is set at the bottom of the food chain I would suggest you keep this in mind before purchasing a Ford productThere are many manufacturers out there that guarantee you a free loaner without purchasing the extended warranty while the car is in the shop for warranty work \"\n",

      "\" In 1992 we bought a new Taurus and we really loved itSo in 1999 we decided to try a new TaurusI did not care for the style of the newer versionbut bought it anyway I do not like the new car half as much as i liked our other oneThee dash is much to deep and takes up a lot of roomI do not find the seats as comfortable and the way the sides stick out further than the strip that should protect your card from denting It drives nice and has good pick upBut you can not see the hood at all from the driver seat and judging and parking is difficultIt has a very small gas tank I would not buy a Taurus if I had it to do overI would rather have my 1992 backI dont think the style is as nice as the the 1992and it was a mistake to change the styleIn less than a month we had a dead battery and a flat tire \"\n",

    "### The Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When shifting focus from the Bayesian model in Task 1 to the LSTM Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for Task 2, my objective was to harness the sophisticated capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a specific category of RNNs, to markedly improve our Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. The core goal centered around addressing the limitations of the Bayesian approach, particularly its dependency on manually curated features, including word stemming and sentiment analysis. I anticipate that a deep learning model capable of independently learning and identifying features from unprocessed text data will prove to be more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayesian model, while effective in certain scenarios, fundamentally treats input features independently, which poses a challenge in NLP tasks where the sequential and contextual nature of language is vital. In contrast, LSTM networks are cleverly designed to address these challenges, boasting an architecture that enables them to remember information over extended sequences. This is achieved through their unique composition of memory cells and a sophisticated system of gates. Including input, forget, and output gates. These regulate the flow of information. Such an arrangement allows LSTMs not only to maintain crucial contextual information across long pasages of text but also to dynamically adapt to new inputs, effectively capturing the intricacies and nuances of natural language."
