    "## OpenWeather API Example\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook we'll be looking at a quick demo of how you can call a web API from Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sign Up\n",
    "If you want to get this notebook to run, you will need to sign up for an *API key* from our example API of choice: OpenWeather. The API key is a way of identifying your code and tying your requests to you. Running this kind of service is not free, and every request has a material cost (bandwidth plus development time, maintenance, and so on). In a demo like this, where you might run the notebook a dozen or so times at most, you are not likely to run into any limits – at the time of writing OpenWeather allow up to 60 calls in a minute and up to 1 million calls in a month on their free tier. But if you were to accidentally write code which repeatedly called the API too often, for example, the API key allows the provider to limit your access.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can sign up at the following address: [https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will get an email confirmation containing your API key, or you can generate one via your account page.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want to sign up, then you can still read all of the text and code in this notebook, and look at the results which are already shown (saved in the notebook itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to experiment, you could also find a different API provider online and adapt the notebook to work with that instead of OpenWeather.\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Key\n",
    "Insert your API key into the code below, e.g.\n",
    "```\n",
    "api_key = 'eac956b1ca02e957ac8a5d6b9f9d00b5'\n",

    "Using `requests` we'll send an HTTP GET request. The details of the URL we need to use is given on the OpenWeather website here: [https://openweathermap.org/current](https://openweathermap.org/current)\n",

We'll cover more about JSON next week, but for now, think of it as some attribute-value pairs – something that can be stored in a Python dictionary, and that's exactly what we'll do. From the sites above, I know that calling the [`.json()`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/?highlight=json#requests.Response.json) method of the object will give a Python dictionary containing the JSON data."
