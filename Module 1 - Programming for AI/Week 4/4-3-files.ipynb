    "## 4.3 – Working With Files\n",
    "### Files\n",
    "At some point once you start writing large applications you are likely to want to read from or write to a file on your system. You might be loading in a bunch of data to process, or you might be saving the progress that the player has made in your game. Even simple programs might want to store and load configuration settings in a separate file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a file in Python, we need to create a *stream*. A stream is an object which allows us to read and write to a sequence of data. That sequence of data does not need to be a file: we might have reason to create an in-memory stream, or we might be reading from a network connection (e.g. over the Internet). But for the purposes of this section, since we are dealing with files, the streams we are using are *file objects*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a file object, we can use the builtin `open` function. This function has many features, but most of the time you will only need to supply the first two arguments:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "open(filename, mode)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first argument, `filename`, is the path of the file you wish to open. Normally you will provide the path as a string, though other options exist. If you write the name of a file on its own, Python will look in the same folder as the script that is running. So we can open the previous notebook as a file by using `\"4-2-random.ipynb\"`. (Note: if you try this, bear in mind that Jupyter files are stored in a [special format](https://nbformat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that you will need to process to be able to do anything sensible. There is an [inbuilt module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) that can help if you're up for it!)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use normal Unix path commands (such as `..` to move up one directory) as well, so another valid path might be `\"../Week 1/1-1-expressions.ipynb\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second argument, `mode`, is a string which controls two things. First, do we want to open the file in *text mode* or in *binary mode*? We will only use text mode in this section, but you might want binary mode if you are dealing with non-text files. The second option is whether we want to read from or write to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few other options for appending, creating, or updating (both read and write) as well, but most of the time, these are the only modes you will need:\n",
    "* `\"r\"` read in text mode (same as `\"rt\"`)\n",
    "* `\"w\"` write in text mode (same as `\"wt\"`)\n",
    "* `\"rb\"` read in binary mode\n",
    "* `\"wb\"` write in binary mode\n",
    "\n",
    "So the following line will open the previous notebook file to read in text mode, and store the file object (the stream) in a variable called `file`:"

    "##### Side Note: Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "While we commonly think about text files being split into lines, it is worth pausing for a second to think about what this actually means. A newline in a text file is actually represented by one or more special characters in the stream of text. It is only when we display it on the screen that we choose to split the text at this point: the actual text data is all sequential. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is some confusion between platforms for historical reasons, but *for the most part* modern applications will understand a single character called the *linefeed* to represent a newline. This character has the decimal ASCII value of 10. But we already use linefeeds (newlines) to even structure our code, there's one at the end of each line! We often want to be able to encode a newline without actually breaking the line of code, so there is a special *escape sequence* which is extremely common: `\\n`."

You never actually need to call the `.close()` method of a file object, if you open it correctly in the first place.\n",
    "\n",

    "This approach is better than manually opening and closing the file, partly because it means you don't have to remember to close it manually after opening, but also because it will still try to close the file even if something odd happens, like if an error occurs while reading the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in the code above the file is only open for a single line: long enough for its entire contents to be read into the variable called `lines`. We then exit the `with` block, which closes the file, and continue processing the text however we like (in this case, just printing it).\n",
    "\n",
    "You should always use a `with` block when dealing with files. If you forget (or are feeling lazy), the file will be still be closed when your application closes.
