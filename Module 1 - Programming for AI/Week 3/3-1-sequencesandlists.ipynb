Interestingly you can also use `.index` with strings if you *want* the method to cause an error when the substring cannot be found. Sometimes this is useful – one of the common principles when developing good Python code is that it is better to “fail loudly”. Returning `-1` might go unnoticed until much later, which might then become a bug that someone has to hunt down. If it had caused an error instead the code would crash, but you would immediately know where the problem was.\n",

We previously wrote functions that took integers and strings as parameters, but since these are *immutable* we could not modify them. Lists are *mutable*, so if you modify an input list in the body of a subroutine, you will modify the original list. This can be intended (as in `square_each_element`), but it can also be accidental. Just including a return statement *does not* prevent this behaviour.\n",

But this can happen even within the same *scope*. This can really mess with your head, so it's okay if this seems a bit confusing, but it's important and learning this now can prevent some headaches later.

    "```python\n",
    "def collatz_sequence(n):\n",
    "    steps = 0\n",
    "    while(n != 1):\n",
    "        print(n)\n",
