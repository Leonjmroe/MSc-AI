    "The choice of whether to use a mutable or immutable type is a design decision. It is somewhat philosophical: we never really *need* to use a tuple; we could use a list and just never modify it, the real world difference would be negligible. Tuples can never grow in size, so they can make more efficient use of memory, but that is about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "However by choosing to use an immutable type you are making a design statement that says you believe this object should not be modified. This means you can pass it into other functions secure in the knowledge that they cannot modify your data. If they try, it will cause an error, and the code will crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be a good thing. Suppose you are using a sequence of items that you do not expect to change. You accidentally call a procedure which modifies the data passed in. If you are using a tuple, you will get an error as soon as you run this line – then you can decide whether you should have called a different function. If you were using a list, you might not notice that the data had changed until something went wrong later. These kinds of logical errors can be hard to find specifically because they *don't* cause the code to crash.\n",
