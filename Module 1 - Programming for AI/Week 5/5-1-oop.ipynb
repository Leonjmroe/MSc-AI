    "### Classes and Objects\n",
    "Again: every variable and literal in Python is an object. But it is slightly easier to explain what an object *is* if we can give an example of something that *is not* an object. So we're going to borrow from another programming language, Java, again for a minute. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Java there are two forms of integer. Additionally, when we declare any variable in Java we must write the *type* before the variable's name – this makes it nice for demonstration since you can see the type without having to work anything out like you do in Python. So take a look at this code, it shows two types of integer, both set to 10:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int primitive = 10;\n",
    "Integer object = new Integer(10);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first variable is a *primitive* integer, the second variable is an *object*. \n",
    "\n",
    "A primitive:\n",
    "* Always has a fixed size in memory. An `int` in Java is 4 bytes.\n",
    "* Is purely data. All 4 bytes are used to store the integer itself, nothing else.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, an object:\n",
    "* Can have a variable size, and a single object can grow in size after creation.\n",
    "* Contains data (attributes) **and** functionality (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, this last point is our key differentiator. Only the object form has its own *actions*, that is, its own *methods*:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Integer object = new Integer(10);\n",
    "String string = object.toString();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method converts the integer to a string, as you can see from the type declaration on the second line. Okay, I'll admit, integer objects in Java do not have very many interesting methods. But strings are more interesting. I think we've mentioned before that in Java a single character is a primitive. But a string is an object – it contains data (a bunch of characters) and functionality (various methods, like the string methods in Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "char character = 'a';\n",
    "String string = \"abcd\";\n",
    "string = string.replace(\"ab\", \"cd\");\n",
    "```\n",

    "The code above creates a string variable, then uses a *method* of that object called `replace` which *returns* a new string object which is then *assigned* to the original variable name. We covered all this in week 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here's something new.\n",
    "\n",
    "We said above that `replace` is a *method* that belongs to the *object*, and on this hinges our entire justification for introducing objects. But... *where exactly* is the code? When we created the string we provided the data, but we did not provide the functionality. In fact, *all* strings have the same methods. And each method, such as `replace` works essentially the same way on all string objects. If we were to write a `replace` function ourselves we might include some branching code, such as an if statement, but that function, that block of code, would not change from string to string.\n",

    "All objects are **instances** of some class.\n",

    "The class specifies properties, and all objects that **instantiate** the class have these properties. Typically that includes two things: attributes and methods – data and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classes for builtin Python types like integers and strings are very complicated and written in C code. So let's write our own class for a stack data structure, like we did previously in the procedural paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at the code below, but focus mostly on the last few lines, the main code, for now."

    "    self.__contents = [0] * size\n",
    "    self.__head = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A few things to note here:\n",
    "* `def`\n",
    " * We create a method inside a class by using a `def`, like any other function.\n",
    "* `__init__`\n",
    " * The constructor must have exactly this name, including the underscores, which are a syntax used by Python to denote names with special meaning so that you are unlikely to accidentally overwrite them. \n",
    " * (We saw this also with `__name__` and `\"__main__\"`.)\n",
    "* `(self, size)`\n",
    " * The first parameter is called `self` – this must be used in **all** of the methods in the class. \n",
    " * `self` exists so that methods can access properties of themselves – the individual object on which they are called.\n",
    " * When you call `my_stack.pop()`, the `self` inside the `.pop(self)` method code becomes a reference to the object `my_stack`.\n",
    "* `self.__contents = ...`\n",
    " * It is common for a constructor to set up the *attributes* (also called *fields*) of the object, this is the data that the object will store. \n",
    " * In this case, we create the array `__contents` and the integer `__head`. We store them “in” the object by writing `self.` before their names.\n",
    " * We can give them any names we like. But here we chose to prefix them with two underscores again. The reason for this is it makes the attributes *private* – we cannot access them directly from outside of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a demonstration of that final point. This demo class has a *public* attribute called `attribute`. Public means it can be directly accessed and changed in code ‘outside’ of the class:"
