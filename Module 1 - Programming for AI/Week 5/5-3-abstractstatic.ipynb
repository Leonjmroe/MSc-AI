    "Now ask this question: does it ever make sense to create an object of the `Vehicle` class? Sure, there are many vehicles we have not included in our system: boats, aeroplanes; in the right application it might make sense to include these. But then surely we'd create new classes for them too? A `Boat` class and an `Aeroplane` class, both could be subclasses of `Vehicle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's quite natural to fall into this pattern when using inheritance. You have some behaviours you want a group of objects to exhibit, but where the exact implementations may differ (polymorphism), and this naturally leads to a common superclass which itself does not provide those implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can formalise this in the object-oriented design by calling that class an *abstract class*. An abstract class is one that cannot be instantiated to create objects, but it exists so that subclasses can be created. Abstract classes usually have *abstract methods* as well – methods that are specified only by their *signature*, the parameters and name of the method, but no implementation is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are two ways to achieve this. In the older style, you simply make it so that anyone calling the method on the base class will hit an exception. Take a look at the code below:"

The methods may contain some implementation (accessible by subclasses using `super()`) or be blank (using `pass`). \n",
