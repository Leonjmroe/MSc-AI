    "We introduced complexity and big O notation with searching lists. As we mentioned on Engage, we are now going to wrap back around and show how we can perform membership tests in (roughly) $O(1)$ time, by creating an implementation of the set data type. You already know what a set is from using Python sets like `{1, 2}`, but how is membership testing so efficient?\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea hinges on the concept of a *hash function*. We alluded to this when we talked about overriding the `__eq__()` method, that it's good practice to override `__hash__()` at the same time. Now let's find out what that actually is.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *hash function* (or just a *hash*) is used for mapping data of *variable* size into data of *fixed* size. Though, this definition is complicated, because every application that requires a hash function will have slightly different requirements. It will be easier to understand if we go through some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our set implementation, we want to accept any data type, but we need to refer to each item by some ID – some way of quickly checking whether two items are equal purely numerically. Hash values do not *necessarily* have to be *unique* in all implementations, but it makes things much easier if they are. If the hash function always returns a unique value for any input, it is called a *universal hash function*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing good hash functions is hard. Python provides a function called `hash` which is extremely useful, though it only works on immutable types."

    "The `hash(…)` function calls the `.__hash__()` method of the object. If we are writing our own classes, the easiest way to define the hash method is to put the constituent parts (i.e. the attributes) into a tuple and hash this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python model instructs us to ensure that if `.__eq__(…)` returns `True` between two objects, then they should have the same `.__hash__()` value. It does not say anything about the reverse implication, but again, truly unique hashes are hard to construct. \n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction will become less important soon anyway, so for now let's assume that the `hash` is always unique, and more usefully, always an integer.\n",

    "### Hash Sets\n",
    "Now let's use this hash function. Hopefully you've guessed how we're going to get $O(1)$ membership testing: we're going to use an array!\n",
    "\n",
    "(Actually, the mechanism here is really similar to the dictionary, you might start spotting the parallels – we'll explain fully in the next notebook.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you create an array which is reasonably large. Let's say it has `n` items, where `n` is much bigger than the number of items you are likely to store. You also have a way of turning objects into unique integers, the `hash(…)` function in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, use this function to find a location inside your array. There is no guarantee the integers are within range (`0` to `n-1`), but that's okay, we can use our old friend modulo. So the location of an object `x` is found with `hash(x) % n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This *is* a function which maps from variable sized data to fixed sized data! This is what some sources use as their definition of a “hash function” – so, confusingly, our hash function *uses* the `hash` function. Also note that this type of hash function *must* result in duplicate values. If `n = 1000`, there are only 1000 possible values for `hash(x) % 1000`, no matter how many possible values there are for `hash(x)`. We know that there are more than 1000 unique objects (there are more than 1000 integers!) so by the [pigeonhole principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle), some must be duplicates. But let's forget that for a second and assume `n` is so big that duplicates are really unlikely. \n",
    "\n",
    "So: given an object `x` we calculate `x_index = hash(x) % n`. Now we use position `x_index` of our array to indicate whether the set contains the object, and magically we get $O(1)$ cost for adding and membership testing, at the expense of a big area of memory (the array).\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we store in the array? Various options – `True` and `False` might seem like an obvious one – but, when `x` is present I am going to store `x` itself, and otherwise I'll store `None`. I'll explain this choice later. Take a look:"

Since we use the same method for adding items into the array an testing for membership, we should be good.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code could hit an infinite loop if the array is completely full! We could detect if we've looped round, but in practice don't actually need to, more on that in a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, let's get back to analysis, do we still actually get $O(1)$ complexity? Certainly not in the worst case: hopefully it's clear we get linear behaviour when there are lots of collisions, because the probing has to keep scanning elements of the array. The proportion of occupied space in the array is called the *load factor*, and the higher this is, the higher the likelihood of a collision. Searches that result in a negative result must keep going until they find a blank space, so if the array is close to full, this can be very slow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear probing is especially negatively impacted if there are lots of items that happen to map into the same array position – a good hash function needs to be evenly spread across the array size, and since in Python `hash(x) = x` when `x` is an integer, it's possible you could get certain patterns of numbers much more often depending on what you are using the set for. This would be a good reason to write our own hash function from scratch. Or we can try to avoid this “grouping” with a different probing technique – for example we could take another application of a hash function to try to move into another area of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided we keep the number of collisions low, the performance is very good, it is still basically $O(1)$ on average. Most hash set implementations will actually *resize* once they reach a certain load factor, and this is especially important with linear probing because it has exponentially worse performance after it hits a load factor of roughly 75-80%. Resizing is costly, of course. We must allocate the new array, then move every item out of the old one and into the new, which likely means recomputing the hash function on every item.\n",

    "### Hashing Revisited\n",
    "Since we can, let's be really barbaric and make a class which totally breaks the hash function. You'll see in the code below that Python's inbuilt set functionality does not get tripped up, so it must be doing the same thing we are here: storing the true value of each item, and comparing them with `==` (`__eq__(…)`) before informing us whether the set contains the value or not."

In this case the hash is designed to make the value *more* complicated, not less.
