    "### The Lesson\n",
    "The lesson here is that *you should use parameters and return values far more often than input and print statements*.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we write short code snippets as demonstrations in an educational context we often use print statements to demonstrate them – we need to get output somehow. But a real command-line application will typically only have a small amount of code that interacts with the user – input and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about a chess application. All of the code that controls the game: how pieces move, whose turn it is, when someone wins, how the AI moves – all of this code is completely agnostic to how the user is interacting with the application, it could have a command line interface or a graphical user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, from now on and for the rest of your programming career, try to separate out the *logic* of your application from the *human interface* of your application. In general, in Python, you typically do not need to use `print` or `input` inside a function, *unless* that function is dedicated to interfacing with the user – we often put the main control loop of our code inside a procedure, and we might move a big block of print statements (such as a main menu) into its own procedure to aid readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "One exception to this is the use of print statements to help you debug code. We'll cover that in the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "But before you move on, here is demonstration of a small program written using the principles discussed in this section and combining many of the concepts from earlier ones. This program does not really solve any real problem, but it is structured in a way we might expect to find a `.py` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Read, analyse, run, and explore the code. Remember how we *trace* code, following the flow of code, jumping from one function to another? Practice that with the code below, try to predict what it will output for various inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you can understand the code, try to add some new text-manipulation functionality. Create a new function, add it to the main menu, and test that it works! Keep it simple. If you can't think of anything else, try inserting your name into the middle of the text. "
