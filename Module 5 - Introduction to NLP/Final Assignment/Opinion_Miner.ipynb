    "Getting the sentiment of multiword phrases using SentiWordNet (SWN) through the NLTK library requires a more nuanced approach compared to single words because SentiWordNet does not directly provide sentiment scores for phrases. Instead, you can average the sentiment scores of individual words in the phrase, adjust the methodology to consider the phrase's context, or use compound term lookup techniques where applicable. Here’s an approach to approximate sentiment for multiword phrases:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Handle Compound Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "Some compound terms might be recognized by SentiWordNet if connected by underscores (e.g., \"well_known\"). Before splitting the phrase into individual words, check if the compound term has an entry in SentiWordNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Average Sentiment Scores of Individual Words\n",
    "\n",
    "For phrases not recognized as compound terms, calculate the average sentiment scores of the individual words. Consideration of part-of-speech tags can enhance accuracy, but for simplicity, this example ignores POS tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This method assumes equal weighting of words in calculating the average sentiment, which might not reflect the actual sentiment conveyed by the phrase.\n",
    "- Handling negations and intensifiers (e.g., \"not\" in \"not good\", \"very\" in \"very good\") requires more sophisticated logic, as they can significantly alter the sentiment.\n",
    "- Advanced models designed for sentiment analysis at the sentence or document level (like BERT-based models) may provide more accurate sentiment assessments for phrases and sentences by considering the broader context.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach gives a basic approximation but is limited by the nuances of natural language. For more accurate sentiment analysis on phrases or sentences, consider using pre-trained sentiment analysis models or services.\n",
